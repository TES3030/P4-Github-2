/*
 * 
 * GraphControl: 
 * Tries to map all points/gameobjects in function curve (time-domain)
 * Manages functions mathematically(?) and the shape of curve (sine, square, triangle etc)
 * 
 * All points (gameobjects) comes from an array. (manual as of now)
 * They are vectors with info on location in 3d-space (x,y,z)
 * X = phase shift of function
 * Y = vertical shift of function
 * Z = n/a - maybe could implement zoom for camera to go closer to curve
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Future: maybe ArrayList for integrating array values better
 * Comments:
